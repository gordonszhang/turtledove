==Game Concept==
My game will be a vertically scrolling space shoot-em-up, featuring gameplay
elements from the classic game Ikaruga.

Enemies of two energy types will appear, firing bullets of black and white energy.
The player ship will have access to a shield that absorbs either white or black
energy (may toggle between the two). Being hit by a bullet of the opposite color
results in the loss of a life.

The player will shoot enemies and dodge bullets throughout a short level, before
facing a boss at the end of the stage. This boss will take the gameplay elements
the player has learned and stretch the player's limits to execute them.

The easiest part of this project:
Adding sound

Problems that I had in completing this project:
Implementing the barrier swapping mechanic
