Project description:
SDL Project 3, an extension of the tracker framework featuring parallax scrolling,
two-way multi-frame sprites, and a dozen other optimizations.

Animation consists of a crystal emitting a flurry of bullets, and a ship
strafing back and forth (two-way multi-frame sprite).

The easiest part of this project:
Fixing code to meet Meyers's standards

Problems that I had in completing this project:
Making the assets--I had the base ship leftover from last project, but had to
animate in-between turning frames and the little booster flares.

Implementing these transitions within the constraints of the program took me a
while.
